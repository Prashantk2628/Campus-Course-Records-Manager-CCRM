### How to Run

1. **Go to the Source Folder**  
  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `src` directory.

2. **Compile the Source Code**  
  Compile all Java files to the `bin` directory:

  ```bash
  javac -d ../bin edu/ccrm/cli/MainApp_Refactored_Methods.java edu/ccrm/domain/*.java edu/ccrm/io/*.java edu/ccrm/service/*.java
  ```
